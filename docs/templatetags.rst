Useful template tags and filters
================================

Next filters and tags can be used when `pybb_tags` loaded in template:

* PyBBM passes all filter_* and may_* methods from current permission handler
  to templates as filters with pybb_ prefix. So you can use they as::

    {% if user|may_view_topic:topic %}
      you can view {{ topic }}
    {% endif %}

  or::

    {% with user|filter_topics:topic_queryset %}
      {# operations on queryset there #}
    {% endwith %}

* `pybb_get_latest_topic` and `pybb_get_latest_posts` assigment tags you can use on
  every page for getting latest topics ans posts, for example for rendering in side block.
  Also you can pass `user` parameter (default to user from template context) for geting topics
  or posts available for specific user and `cnt` parameter for get specific count of topics
  or posts::

    {% pybb_get_latest_topic cnt=30 as topics %}
    {# operation on topics list there #}

* `pybb_get_profile` assigment tag can be used to get forum profile instance for any user
  passed as `user` argument::

    {% pybb_get_profile user=post.user as post_user_profile %}
    {# use profile fields there #}
