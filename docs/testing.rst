Testing and extending
=====================

Testing
-------

PyBBM has good unittest coverage. To test PyBBM you need:

* Django > 1.3
* lxml
* PIL
* All PyBBM dependencies

Go to `test/example_bootstrap` or `test/example_thirdparty` directory and run::

    python manage.py test pybb


Extending

Development happens on github, with main repo: https://github.com/hovel/pybbm
