What is PYBBM?
=============

PyBB - originally created by Grigoriy Petukhov currently unmaintained.

PyBBM - modified version of pybb, created to continue project development.

The main point in development of pybb is to build it so it could be
*easily* integrated to existing django based site. This mean:

* pybb does not provide features like user registration, password restoring.
  It does not provide authentication page. You should use your favorite
  application for such things. You can try well known django-registration
  http://code.google.com/p/django-registration/ or lorien own implementation
  http://hg.pydev.ru/django-account. Both applications contain install instruction
  in the distributive.

* PyBB Modified features against original PyBB:
  * pybbm uses get_profile() anywhere to populate additional user information (such as avatar,
    signature, or other stuff), you should inherit your profile class from pybb.models.PybbProfile
    or manually add all fields from this class to your.
  * All settings of pybbm have default values, see default.py file for detailed list.
  * pybbm templates fill *content*, *head*, *title* and *breadcrumb* blocks for template defined
    in settings as PYBB_TEMPLATE ("base.html" by default).
  * Markup engines can be configured as ordinary settings.
  * pybbm designed to fit django-staticfiles (django <= 1.2) or django.contrib.staticfiles (django >= 1.3).
  * Default pybbm templates and css files include only layout, minimal design and no coloring to easily
    fits any existed site colorscheme.
  * PyBBM code covered with tests more than 80%
  * PyBBM provides completely rewritten unread tracking with big performance improvement on large database
  * Views rewritten to use as many generics as possible
  * Number of external dependencies significantly reduced

  
How to install PYBBM?
====================

* Firstly you have to install pybb. You have two ways:
  * Install pybb with easy_install or pip tools
  * Clone pybb repository from http://bitbucket.org/zeus/pybb and place it in your project

* Put `pybb` into settings.INSTALLED_APPS
* Put `include('pybb.urls'))` into main project urls.py file
* Add `pybb.context_processors.processor` to your settings.CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
* Add `pybb.middleware.PybbMiddleware` to your settings.MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES
* Do `manage.py migrate` if you have South installed or 'manage.py syncdb'

* Your base template should provide *content*, *head*, *title* and *breadcrumb* blocks

* If you want to migrate old pybb profiles to your.site.profile use  migrate_profile manage.py command


i18n support
============
PYBB support only english and russian translations now.
You should enable django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware to activate
django locale autodetecting.


How to glue PYBB with account application?
==========================================
* For registration, login, logout links PYBB uses reverse and url template tag
  with names same to django-registration application. Django-account uses the same
  names too. This mean that if you want use one of these two application then
  all you need is to correctly install one.
* If you account application use specific url names or don't use them at all then
  you have two ways:
  * edit PYBB sources and write correct urls
  * add required url names to account application urlpatterns
??? * Don't forget to write valid LOGIN_URL to the settings
